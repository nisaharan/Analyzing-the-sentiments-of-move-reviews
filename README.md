# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Moview-review

In this project, I performed sentiment analysis on movie reviews using various classification algorithms. The goal was to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative based on their content.

To accomplish this, I utilized the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library. NLTK provided essential functionalities for preprocessing the text data and extracting meaningful features for classification.

The workflow of the project consisted of the following steps:

Data Collection: I obtained a dataset of movie reviews from kaggle. The dataset contained a collection of reviews along with their corresponding sentiment labels (positive or negative).

Data Preprocessing: I performed essential preprocessing steps to clean and normalize the text data. This involved tasks such as removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and eliminating stop words.

Feature Extraction: Next, I extracted relevant features from the preprocessed text data. This step involved techniques like bag-of-words representation or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numerical features that machine learning algorithms can understand.

Classification Algorithms: I experimented with various classification algorithms available in NLTK. Some of the algorithms I used include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest. Each algorithm was trained on the labeled movie reviews data to learn patterns and make predictions.

Evaluation and Comparison: To assess the performance of the classification algorithms, I employed confusion matrices. A confusion matrix provided a detailed analysis of the predictions made by the algorithms, including the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. By comparing the confusion matrices, I could determine the effectiveness of each algorithm in classifying movie reviews.
